Problem: Given a URL download all images; Try to do image download concurrently

Images Download Tool written in Go
Solution:
/*Download all images from a specific webpage*/ 

Working: 
steps to test the idea :
1. cURL the webpage
2. get the links of all Images
3. download all images into a known directory (locally)

<!-- Notes :
- regex for all jpg and png files: `[a-zA-Z0-9/_.:-]+.(jpg|png)`
- get all image files into array, then loop for download them all
- if the file starts with `//` then replace it with `https://` or add `http:` before `//`. -->

Steps to use:
1) Build main.go /*go build main.go*/
2) ./main get <url> /*url used in code is - https://www.pinterest.com/BootheDeafKitty/beautiful-and-special-cats-of-pintrest/*/
3) Images will be downloaded to saved_images directory 
4) testdata.html isin't required by the project, just used it to find jpg and png in website html code, using regexp
